MP3 JUKEBOX
-----------

Target of the project is to create a physically 
acessible MP3-Jukebox/Trading-Post. The device is 
here to support the exchange of mp3s with friends 
in a semi-private enviroment.

Since all mp3-players in switzerland have royalties 
slapped on them. This system is absolutley legal and
consists of a way to share music in a convenient way 
as well as a jukebox for the night.

It is intended to get installed at social gathering 
places like the 0 series prototype here is in a private
den open to the leadership of the scouts Pfadi Patria
Bern. Most of these users regularly bring in their mp3
player to a weekly social meeting where people talk, 
party and listen to music. Right now at the begining of
the project, users usually just make a grab for the plug 
connected to the amp and plug their sound in. often tracks
don't get listened through, at other times some put in 
a short playlist on repeat and that doesn't get noticed 
for hours (until the sound really sucks). This system
aims to support its users in keeping the sound diverse
and on a good track with out to much interaction.

The main interface will finally be a touch screen with
on board virtual keyboard. For now the touch screen is
replaced by an internal (in the screen) trackball. This
is due to the reason that the prototype was actually 
created on a NULL budget with almost no funding. Thus a 
modern SoC would probablly bring about the same
performance as the aging PIII thats in use now.

The user interface is made up of the excellent matchbox-
keyboard and amarok. For touch screen purposes amaroks
layout (button sizes) would probably need quite some 
tweaking. on the other hand an always randomizing 
interface with a hype/plonk system would be rather nice 
as an mp3 player too!

Sharing music is a quite manual process for now. The 
standard amarok interface allows users to drag an drop 
stuff between devices and the local collection and to synch
them in a click. basic transcoding is also supported but i 
dont expect to get loads of users with strange formats no one
elses player can play.


DATA MINING
-----------
Yes, to be honest i expect to get some meaningful data out
of this experiment. First of all there's last.fm, the data 
aggregated there is probablly gonna make more sense for the 
users. Then i have installed some scripts to just dump some 
data on the average usage. Maybe some day i'll be able to 
publish something based off that data. The data im trying to 
get is like follows:

- local hard disk space (free/used/total) (all drives in /media 
  && /etc/fstab)
- external devices seen (as reported by hal, on mounting)
- uptimes (amount and day)
- file stats (type of media files ie. mp3/wma/...)
- file count/file sizes
- amarok stats dump

All collected data will be handled carefully and anonymously.
Later i will probably do a hand-out questionaire to get some 
exacter demographics on the users.
Most of the data will get dumped on halt. Thats why the system 
does take some time to halt itself. 


TARGET DEVICES
--------------
For testing the MP3 Player integration the following
devices were available:

- Creative Zen Touch (mtp)
- Palm LifeDrive (mass storage)
- various other mass storage devices (that are less 
  broken than the palm)
- (3d gen ipod)

I still need to find an ipod for testing, the needed 
libs are installed so it should actually work.

If you want your device to work, talk to me and we'll
devise a solution. If your player has too much drm 
consider buying a better one or getting your mp3s 
elsewhere.

DOCS

Look in /usr/share/doc on the box and you'll find docs aplenty!
